# Image-Editor
This is a simple program written in Java that allows you to load in a .bmp image, draw over it with a limited number of colors, and export it again.
To load an image, drag and drop it onto the edit window. Save with the save button or ctrl+s. 
By default, the output will be saved to the same directory as the image that was originally loaded.
